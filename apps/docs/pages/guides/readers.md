# Built-in Readers

Stump has a few different built-in readers that you can use to read your books. These readers are geared towards specific use cases, but Stump handles the decision of which reader to use for you. The interfaces for each will be different, aimed at supporting the experience the reader is designed for:

- **Ebook reader**: A reader for reading ebooks, such as `.epub` files.
  - A _Streamable_ ebook reader is planned for a future release, which will allow you to read ebooks in a more network friendly way.
- **Image-based reader**: A reader for reading image based books. These are primarily archive files, such as `.cbz`/`zip` and `.cbr`/`rar` files.
- **PDF reader**: A reader for reading PDF files. **Not yet implemented!**
